# django-rest-project

This is an example to show how the Django Rest Framework and asyncrhonous views work.

To run it:

1. Install the requirements.

2. Create one or multiple superusers in the provider app. One of these users needs to be called "admin" and have the password "password":

```
cd provider
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

3. Run the provider server:

```
./manage.py runserver
```

This will run the django provider project on port 8000. It includes the Django Rest Framework and is a slightly modified version of https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/ .

4. Try to connect with the provider looking at http://localhost:8000/users/ in a browser.You can log in and browse around. You can add more users via the command line or http://localhost:8000/admin/

5. In another terminal setup and run the consumer app:

```
cd consumer
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser # Create at least one user
./manage.py runserver
```

6. Take a look at the output of the consumer app in a browser at http://localhost:7000/users/

=====

**Tasks**

1. Expand the consumer project. Create views for individual users and create links to them from the overview/index page.

2. Expand the provider project. Create your own models and serializers. Then make them available through the consumer project.

3. Add an interface and methods to modify fields on an existing model instance, create new model instances or delete existing ones.
